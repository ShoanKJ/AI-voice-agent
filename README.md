# AI-voice-agent
Iâ€™ve built a voice agent with FastAPI backend and browser-based JS frontend. It generates speech via Murf.ai TTS, serves static/template files, and saves uploads in /uploads. Features include text-to-speech, mic recording with MediaRecorder API, and an /upload-audio endpoint returning file metadata.
